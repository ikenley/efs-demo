# EFS Demo

Terraform code which demonstrates how to create a secure, HIPAA-compliant, highly available, multi-region [AWS Elastic File System (EFS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/getting-started.html) cluster.

It will also create example EC2 and ECS compute resources which automatically mount to EFS.
